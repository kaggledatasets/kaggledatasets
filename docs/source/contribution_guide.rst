Contributing Guide
==================

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

Before you start
----------------

* Comment on the issue that you plan to work on so we can assign it to you and there isn't unnecessary duplication of work.
* When you plan to work on something larger (for example, adding new features to Dataset Class), please respond on the issue (or create one if there isn't one) to explain your plan and give others a chance to discuss.
* If you're fixing some smaller issue - please check the list of pending Pull Requests to avoid unnecessary duplication.

How can you help
----------------

You can help in multiple ways: 
* Reproducing bugs, finding its root cause and providing fixes to that, this will be appreciated a lot (see the issues with label: `bug`)
* Sending Pull Requests for new kaggle datasets and/or requested features (see the issues with label: `dataset request` or `enhancement`)
* Doing Code Reviews on the Pull Requests from the developers of this community and verifying if PRs are working correctly or not


Datasets
--------

Adding a Kaggle Dataset is a great way of making it more accessible to the various communities. `Add a new Kaggle Dataset <>`_ guide will be available soon.

Tests
-----

We use `pylint <https://www.pylint.org/>`_ for ensuring kaggledatasets is nice and easy to use and work on long-term, all modules should have clear tests for public members.
